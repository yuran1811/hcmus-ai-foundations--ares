\subsection{Swarm Algorithm}

\subsubsection{Pseudocode}

\subsubsection{Implementation}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{\_\_init\_\_(...)}  
    Initializes the Swarm search algorithm with grid dimensions, matrix representation, initial player position, stone positions, and switch positions. It also includes options for deadlock detection and heuristic optimization.

    \item \textbf{search()}  
    Defines the base search function for Swarm, Swarm Convergent, and Swarm Bidirectional approaches. Currently, the function tracks expanded nodes but does not implement a complete pathfinding process.

    \item \textbf{heuristic(stones\_pos, switches\_pos)}  
    Computes the heuristic function to estimate the cost to reach the goal. The function dynamically selects between the Hungarian heuristic and Manhattan heuristic based on the optimization flag.

    \item \textbf{mahattan\_heuristic(stones\_pos, switches\_pos)}  
    Uses the Manhattan distance to estimate the cost, summing the minimum weighted distances from each stone to a switch.

    \item \textbf{hungarian\_heuristic(stones\_pos, switches\_pos)}  
    Utilizes the Hungarian algorithm to optimally assign stones to switches, minimizing the total weighted Manhattan distance.

    \item \textbf{SwarmConvergent.search()}  
    Implements a variant of Swarm where multiple paths converge towards a solution. Currently, it maintains a set of explored states without a full implementation.

    \item \textbf{SwarmBidirectional.search()}  
    Implements a bidirectional search variant of Swarm, exploring the state space from both the start and goal positions simultaneously. It maintains a set of explored states but lacks a fully developed pathfinding process.

    \item \textbf{AntColonyOptimization.\_\_init\_\_(...)}  
    Initializes the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) search algorithm with the same parameters as Swarm, allowing for heuristic-based optimizations.

    \item \textbf{AntColonyOptimization.search()}  
    Implements the base ACO search function, tracking expanded states but lacking full functionality.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Time and Space Complexity}
\textbf{Time Complexity:} Highly dependent on the heuristic used. The Hungarian heuristic runs in \( O(n^3) \), while Manhattan distance runs in \( O(n) \). Overall, complexity varies between \( O(n^3) \) and \( O(b^d) \).

\textbf{Space Complexity:} \( O(b^d) \), as it stores visited states.
