\subsection{Uniform Cost Search}
\noindent For any search problem, Uniform Cost Search (UCS) is the better algorithm than the previous ones. The search algorithm explores in branches with more or less same cost. This consist of a priority queue where the path from the root to the node is the stored element and the depth to a particular node acts as the priority. UCS assumes all the costs to be non negative. While the DFS algorithm gives maximum priority to maximum depth, this gives maximum priority to the minimum cumulative cost.

\subsubsection{Pseudo Code}
\begin{algorithm}[H]
	\caption{Uniform Cost Search (\textit{state, maxtimeout})}
	\label{alg:ucs}
	\begin{algorithmic}[1]
	\State priority queue $\gets$ starting position of Sokoban
	\State cost $\gets$ cost of moves
	\While {queue is not empty}
		\State Remove the highest priority element of queue
		\If {Ares crates on target}
			\State break
		\Else
			\If {Is deadlock or time $\geq$ maxtimeout}
				\State pick next solution
			\Else
				\State Get valid moves for Sokoban
				\ForAll {move}
					\State cost $\gets$ cost of move
					\State Add cost to current move
					\State Update queue with new cost and new state
				\EndFor
			\EndIf
		\EndIf
	\EndWhile
	\State \Return moves
	\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
