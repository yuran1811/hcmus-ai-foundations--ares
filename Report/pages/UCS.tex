\subsection{Uniform Cost Search}
\noindent For any search problem, Uniform Cost Search (UCS) is the better algorithm than the previous ones. The search algorithm explores in branches with more or less same cost. This consist of a priority queue where the path from the root to the node is the stored element and the depth to a particular node acts as the priority. UCS assumes all the costs to be non negative. While the DFS algorithm gives maximum priority to maximum depth, this gives maximum priority to the minimum cumulative cost.

\subsubsection{Pseudocode}
\begin{algorithm}[H]
	\caption{Uniform Cost Search (\textit{start, goal})}
	\label{alg:ucs}
	\begin{algorithmic}[1]
	\State priority queue \(\gets\) [(start, cost = 0)]
	\While {priority queue is not empty}
		\State (node, cost) \(\gets\) dequeue(priority queue)
		\If {node = goal}
			\State return path
		\EndIf
		\ForAll {neighbor in valid moves}
			\State new cost \(\gets\) cost + move cost
			\If {neighbor not visited or new cost \(<\) previous cost}
				\State mark neighbor as visited
				\State enqueue(priority queue, (neighbor, new cost))
			\EndIf
		\EndFor
	\EndWhile
	\State return failure
	\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\subsubsection{Implementation}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{\_\_init\_\_(...)}  
    Initializes the Uniform Cost Search (UCS) algorithm with grid dimensions, matrix representation, initial player position, stone positions, and switch positions. It also includes an option for deadlock detection. The initial state's cost \( g \) is set to zero.

    \item \textbf{search()}  
    Implements the UCS algorithm using a priority queue (min-heap). The function expands the node with the lowest accumulated cost \( g \) at each step. It explores all possible states, updating costs and storing them in a hash table for efficient lookup.

    \item \textbf{handle(new\_state, closed, frontier, state\_hash\_table)}  
    Manages newly generated states, adding them to the frontier if they have not been visited or updating their cost if a lower-cost path is found.

    \item \textbf{can\_go(current\_state, dir)}  
    Checks whether the player can move in a given direction from the current state without encountering obstacles.

    \item \textbf{go(current\_state, dir)}  
    Generates a new state by moving the player in the specified direction, updating positions, and recalculating cost values.

    \item \textbf{construct\_path(final\_state)}  
    Reconstructs the sequence of moves leading to the goal state by backtracking from the final state.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Time and Space Complexity}
\textbf{Time Complexity:} \( O(b^C) \), where \( C \) is the cost of the optimal solution. In the worst case, UCS expands all nodes up to the goal depth.

\textbf{Space Complexity:} \( O(b^C) \), as it stores all expanded nodes in memory.
